## **üßê The Problem This Solves (Why I Built This)**

I created this workflow to solve a common problem: getting distracted by social media algorithms.

When I wanted to quickly check the latest news from a few trusted journalists on X (Twitter), I would inevitably get pulled into the platform. Reading comments, seeing suggested posts, or clicking on tempting images meant a 5-10 minute news check often resulted in wasting 45 minutes to an hour.

The goal was simple: **Extract the important news from specific sources and consume it in a clean, distraction-free format.**

## **üí° Key Features & User Benefits**

This tool gives you complete control over your news consumption:

- **Major Time Savings:** Reduces your daily news reading time from 45 minutes of platform scrolling to a focused, distraction-free session of **just 5-10 minutes**.

- **Complete Customization:** You can easily add any number of X (Twitter) usernames and YouTube video URLs to the workflow.
- **Multi-Format Output:** Generates four outputs: three HTML digests ‚Äî a comprehensive tweet roundup, a shorter news summary, and a YouTube news overview. Plus an MP3 audio file styled as a radio news broadcast.
- **AI Synthesis & Summarization:** The workflow uses AI to group related topics from different journalists and creates short summaries of long articles or video transcripts.
- **Delivered on Telegram:** All final digests are delivered directly to your Telegram bot. You never have to log into X or YouTube to get your daily update.

### **‚öôÔ∏è How the Workflow Works**

This workflow processes X/Twitter content first, then YouTube content, generating multiple digest files along the way before sending the final notifications.

**Part 1: X/Twitter Processing:** The workflow scrapes all recent tweets from the specified users. It uses **Gemini AI** to summarize long posts, then aggregates all the data.

Then, it generates three parallel outputs: the `Raw Tweets Digest`, the AI-synthesized `Structured News Digest`, and the `MP3 Audio Broadcast` (created using FAL AI).

**Part 2: YouTube Processing:** After the Twitter digest is handled, the workflow scrapes transcripts for the provided video URLs. **Gemini AI** creates a detailed summary for each one, which is then formatted into the final `YouTube Summary Digest`.

**Delivery:** Once the files are ready, they are uploaded to **Cloudflare R2** and the links are sent via separate **Telegram Bot** messages.
